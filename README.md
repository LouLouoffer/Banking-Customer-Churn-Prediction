# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction
## EDA&Analyze.ipynb
* Preprocessed Bank Customer data set by data cleaning, categorical feature encoding, and standardization, etc.
* Trained supervised learning model via Python to predict customer churn rates based on labelled data, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighborhoods; identified the optimal model with an accuracy of 86.5%
* Evaluated model performance of classification (accuracy, f1 or AUC score) via k-fold cross-validation technique and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results
## ETL.py
* Develop ETL pipelines, load bank customer data from CSV files, preprocess the data set by data cleaning, categorical feature encoding, and standardization, etc.
* Automatically upload the cleaned data and model evaluation results to the internal database.
